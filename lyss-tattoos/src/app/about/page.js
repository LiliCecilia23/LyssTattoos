            <p>Welcome! I’m Lyss, and I’m a tattoo artist currently based out of Ants Tattoo in San Jose, California.</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>Before becoming a tattoo artist, I worked as an archaeologist. I studied Anthropology and Digital Archaeology at Dartmouth, The University of York, and Stanford. I focused the majority of my research in Cambodia, where I used remote sensing to study the hydrological systems of the Ancient Khmer Empire. Archaeology was something I loved doing, but ultimately I decided that I had gotten everything that I wanted from it and it was time to try something new.</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>Once I entered the corporate world of the constant 9-5, I felt myself yearning for this creative outlet more and more – tattoos and artwork became a central source of joy in my life. With each new tattoo I got, I felt more and more like myself, and have grown so much in my queerness and love for art because of it. This made me realize that this was the direction I wanted to take my career; I want to provide these same feelings to others through tattooing and collaborating with my clients. In October 2023, I landed an apprenticeship at Ants Tattoo.. Since I’ve started there I’ve felt so at home with the community the shop has created and for the first time I wake up excited every day to do my job!</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>If you book with me, you’ll find a welcoming and inclusive atmosphere where ideas flow freely. I believe that tattoos should be more than just ink on skin; they should be a reflection of your journey, you passions, and your identity.</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>So, if you’re ready to turn your ideas into reality and join me on this adventure of self-expression, I can’t wait to meet you! Let’s make some magic together.</p>
